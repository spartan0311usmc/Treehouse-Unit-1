              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining the Marines, I shipped out for boot camp the day after I graduated high school. Stationed at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was assigned to the most decorated battalion in the Marines, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. I deployed three times to as many as 13 different countries around the globe. After my honorable discharge in January 2011, I moved to Nebraska where I lived for 3 years, then back to my home state of Washington.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once back home, I decide to join the military again, this time as a National Guardman, which only requires one weekend a month and two weeks a year of duty and training.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While living in Nebraska and applying for a police department position, I attended a four week truck driving school as a back up plan if I didn't get hired. Though, I was hired at the police department, It wasn't long before I had to leave back to Washington in pursuit of getting custody of my children.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once there, I needed to stay and fight for my children, and the only avenue available to me was my newly acquired CDL (Commercial Drivers License), so I quickly put it to work, and that's where the main focus of my work experience as an adult has been, up until now, as I learn programming and development as a way to bring me back home every night with my wife and children.</p>
