        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently a long haul truck driver. I am rapidly learning how to build beautiful and responsive websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My intention is to develop my skills as a web developer, to the point where I can step out of a truck, and into the exciting field of tech. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served for 8 years in the military. 4 years in the Marine Corps and 4 in the Army. Upon getting out, I did not have any solid trade skills, and pursued high demand jobs that paid well, which was truck driving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was awarded custody of my children after a long but needed process, and am now looking at developing my skills in the tech industry, so that I can be home every night and give them a much better life.</p>
